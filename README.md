## Autonomous Car

See self-driving in action


  A scaled down version of self-driving system using a RC car, Raspberry Pi, Arduino and open source software. The system uses a Raspberry Pi with a camera and an ultrasonic sensor as inputs, a processing computer that handles steering, object recognition (stop sign and traffic light) and distance measurement, and an Arduino board for RC car control.
